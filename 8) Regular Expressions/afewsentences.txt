The stimuli provided to the neuron cultures differed in terms of intensity and predictability. The neurons in the sensory region were regularly provided with weak jolts that encoded the position of the ball in the game, according to the paper. When neurons in the motor regions behaved in such a way that they successfully lined up the paddle with the ball to bounce it back across the screen, sensory region neurons were given a predictable stimulus that fostered neuronal connectivityâ€”the neuronal equivalent of a reward. When they failed to do so, they were given an unpredictable stimulus that was longer and more intense, resulting in disruption to the culture. The neurons soon learned to avoid the disruptive stimuli and seek out the hit condition.
