review
"One of the other reviewers has mentioned that after watching just 1 Oz episode you'll be hooked and are right, as this is exactly what happened with me.   "
A wonderful little production. 
"I thought this was a wonderful way to spend time on a too hot summer weekend, sitting in the air conditioned theater and watching a light-hearted comedy. "
Basically there's a family where a little boy (Jake) thinks there's a zombie in his closet & his parents are fighting all the time.
Petter Mattei's Love in the Time of Money is a visually stunning film to watch. 
"Probably my all-time favorite movie, a story of selflessness, sacrifice and dedication to a noble cause, but it's not preachy or boring."
"This show was an amazing, fresh & innovative idea in the 70's when it first aired. "
Encouraged by the positive comments about this film on here I was looking forward to watching this film. 
If you like original gut wrenching laughter you will like this movie. 
Phil the Alien is one of those quirky films where the humour is based around the oddness of everything rather than actual punchlines.
"I appreciate that this is trying to bring Shakespeare to the masses, but why ruin something so good."
This a fantastic movie of three prisoners who become famous. 
Some films just simply should not be remade. 
This movie made it into one of my top 10 most awful movies. .
I had the terrible misfortune of having to view this b-movie in it's entirety..
This was the worst movie I saw at WorldFest and it also received the least amount of applause afterwards.
The Karen Carpenter Story shows a little more about singer Karen Carpenter's complex life. 
This movie was so frustrating. 
My first exposure to the Templarios and not a good one. 
One of the most significant quotes from the entire film is pronounced halfway through by the protagonist.
I watched this film not really expecting much.
This movie struck home for me. 
Protocol is an implausible movie whose only saving grace is that it stars Goldie Hawn along with a good cast of supporting actors. 
"How this film could be classified as drama, I have no idea. "
Bela Lugosi appeared in several of these low budget chillers for Monogram Studios.
I cannot believe I enjoyed this as much as I did. .
"As someone has already mentioned on this board, it's very difficult to make a fake documentary. ."
The Hills Have Eyes II is what you would expect it to be and nothing more. 
I laughed all the way through this rotten movie. 
" What we have here is basically a solid and plausible premise and with a decent and talented cast, but somewhere the movie loses it. "
"Not only was the plot was difficult to follow, but it seems character development was randomly applied."
"Besides being boring, the scenes were oppressive and dark. "
I really like Salman Kahn so I was really disappointed when I seen this movie. 
I'm not sure why the producers needed to trade on the name of a somewhat successful movie franchise because the title suggests that it is a sequel to the first three movies.
This film laboured along with some of the most predictable story lines and shallow characters ever seen. 
Caddyshack Two is a good movie by itself but compared to the original it cant stack up. 
It tries to be the epic adventure of the century. 
This film took me by surprise. 
Stephen Hawkings is a genius.  
"The story is about a psychic woman, Tory, who returns to her hometown and begins reliving her traumatic childhood past the death of her childhood friend and abusive father."
"We brought this film as a joke for a friend, and could of been our worst joke to play. "
This is a typical Steele novel production in that two people who have undergone some sort of tragedy manage to get together despite the odds. 
Hollywood movie industry is the laziest one in the entire world. 
"If anyone is wondering why no one makes movies like they used to, with conversation, character and a simple theme of friendship struggling to evolve into something new, better and different, those folks need to take in this film and see top notch writing, directing, and acting that melds into a wonderful evening of observation on how things used to be in Italy and England."
"I watched this series out of curiosity,wanting to see if they could possibly and with ALL this modern technology,out do Cecil B. DeMille's classic epic of 1956, starring Charleton Heston,Yul Brenner and Sir Cedric Hardwicke. "
Daniel Day-Lewis is the most versatile actor alive. 
"My guess would be this was originally going to be at least two parts, and thus at least a quarter longer, because otherwise how can one explain its confused, abbreviated storyline. "
"Well, I like to watch bad horror B-Movies, cause I think it's interesting to see stupidity and unability of creators to shoot seriously good movie."
"This is the worst movie I have ever seen, as well as, the worst that I will probably ever see. "
